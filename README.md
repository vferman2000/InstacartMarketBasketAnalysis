# Instacart Market Basket Analysis 

**A Product Recommendation System for the Digital Customer**

The online grocery marketplace is in the middle of digital disruption.  Consumers increasingly shop for food, personal care items, and other household items through apps and websites that offer products delivered to their homes.  In addition, the increasing number of online consumers present online stores with the opportunity and challenge to curate to their taste in a personalized and timely manner. 

A product recommendation system that utilizes the power of machine learning can streamline the consumer journey by showcasing the right products at the right time at a mass scale. 

An efficient machine learning model can find trends in customers' historical data and predict which products are most relevant.  Stakeholders can also apply this knowledge to personalize the shopping content of other users with similar characteristics.

**The Instacart Prediction Challenge**

Instacart is one of the companies in the digital grocery space.  It provides grocery delivery services to users across the U.S and Canada.  Users place their grocery orders through the Instacart app, and a personal Instacart shopper delivers the order to their home.

Instacart made public anonymized data of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users and presented the 'Instacart Market Basket Analysis' challenge of predicting which previously purchased products would be in the users' next order.  Instacart introduced the challenge through Kaggle, a data science and data engineers community.

The Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time.  The following pages of the report analyze historical trends and patterns in user behavior.  And it will result in the machine learning development of a product recommendation model. 

**Best Model Selection**

The analysis compares three machine learning algorithms that will build models based on the sample data.  Finally, the report concludes with a sample of a predicted shopping cart for an Instacart user.

Python Programming Language has been chosen as the programming language for the analysis.
